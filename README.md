# 🌍 Life Expectancy Analysis

This project explores the factors influencing life expectancy across countries using statistical analysis and data visualization. It leverages real-world WHO data to find patterns and correlations that impact human longevity.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Identify key social, economic, and health-related factors that affect life expectancy.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of health and economic indicators
- Correlation heatmaps and feature importance
- Visual insights into global disparities in life expectancy

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Country-wise life expectancy values
- Indicators like GDP, schooling, health expenditure, mortality rates, etc.

> Source: World Health Organization (via Kaggle or public dataset)

## 📈 Key Insights

- Positive correlation found between life expectancy and factors like GDP and schooling
- Negative correlation observed with mortality rate and HIV prevalence
- Health expenditure and BMI are significant contributors

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Apply machine learning to predict life expectancy
- Add regional filtering and interactive dashboards
